    <h1>Pistachio-Crusted Salmon</h1>

    <img src="../images/salmon-pistachio.jpg" alt="salmon-pistachio">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Make ordinary salmon extra special by topping it with a pistachio-panko-Parmesan 
        crust," says France C. "You can have it on the table in under 30 minutes for a 
        quick weeknight meal or a dinner party for guests. Serve with a chilled glass of 
        Sauvignon Blanc."
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup crushed pistachios</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon with skin, center cut</li>
        <li>and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine pistachios, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and butter in a small bowl; stir with a fork until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Lightly season salmon fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Sear salmon fillets, flesh-side down, for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn heat off and flip salmon pieces over so skin side is down.</li>
        <li>Brush tops of salmon evenly with Dijon mustard. Top with pistachio mixture, pressing mixture down onto salmon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
